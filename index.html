            My favorite Thai restaurant in the city. I like spicy food, but
            they're on a higher scale of spiciness. When they ask how hot
            you want it from 1 - 5 I think 2 is good and hot
            (I swear I'm not a total spice wimp!)

             alt="Plate of coconut rice, spinach, and fried plantains">
        <p>
            Really good African cuisine with influences from The Gambia
            and Cameroon. As the chef
            <a href="https://www.bryant-terry.com/" target="_blank">Bryant Terry</a>
            noted, a lot of what we think of as Southern food in the US
            has roots in African cuisine, so the food here isn't so unfamiliar.
            In some ways there is more of a veggie focus than in your typical
            Southern US food, which is nice.

            Vietnamese-Louisianian fusion restaurant, highly acclaimed
            by local chefs in particular. New Orleans actually has a
            strong Vietnamese culture and some Vietnamese food has a
            common French influence with New Orleans Creole food. The "po-mi"
            is a play on words combining the New Orleans po-boy and Vietnamese
            bahn-mi, which are similar kinds of sandwiches.
